      "Back in June, 2021 I donated to one of Madinah's Yemen campaigns. It was just a $10 donation. I donated it for my 10 years ago passed away grandmother. I felt like wanting to die to go to paradise and I then realized that I donated the $10 to my Grandmother's soul just 3 days ago. That is probably the reason Allah showed me this vision. Thanks Madinah.",
